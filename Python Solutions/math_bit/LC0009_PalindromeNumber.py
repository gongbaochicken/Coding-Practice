"""
Problem: PalindromeNumber
Difficulty: [Easy/Medium/Hard]
Source: LeetCode #0009

Description:
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome
when it reads the same backward as forward.
Example 1:
Input: 121
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
