Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. For the above tables, Max has the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.

+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |

| IT         | Max      | 90000  |

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT d.Name AS Department, e.Name AS Employee, e.Salary AS Salary
FROM Employee AS e INNER JOIN Department AS d
ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE e.Salary in (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee where DepartmentId = e.DepartmentId GROUP BY DepartmentId);
-- # Corner case : [["IT","Joe",60000],["IT","Sam",50000],["HR","Max",50000]]}
