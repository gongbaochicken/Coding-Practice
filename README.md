# :rocket: Coding Practice

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I collect my C++ solutions to algorithm problems sourced from LeetCode, Lintcode, and HackerRank. Remember, practice makes perfect! :octocat:

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here
In this repository, you will find:

- C++ solutions to various algorithm challenges.
- Ongoing updates with information on basic knowledge of Linux shell commands, database concepts, and more.

## Goal
My aim is to create a resource that not only sharpens our coding skills but also serves as inspiration for anyone preparing for coding interviews. If you like this repo, please consider giving a star to support this project. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
